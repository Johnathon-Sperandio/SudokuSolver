# SudokuSolver

## This is an automatic Sodoku Solver that utilizes backtracking and number storage to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles

- This is not intended to be an optimized project, it is just for me to relearn the basics of coding in a fun way
* I will do this project in python first
* I may redo it in other languages later.
